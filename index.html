        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Javascript technical documentation page! this project was suggested by freeCodeCamp Web Responsive Design Certification.</p>

        <h2>Javascript Summary</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language used for web development and other technology areas.Javascript is a loosely typed language meaning variables can hold any type of values. In the technology community, it is relatively easy for developers to learn. JavaScript is often used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages, allowing developers to dynamically update and change the content and structure of a webpage. Javascript has a wide range of tools available to use.</p>

        <h2>Importance of Javascript</h2>
        <p>Listed below are important aspects of the Javascript programming languages.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
          <li>Client-Side Interactivity</li>
          <li>Dynamic Content</li>
          <li>Form Validation</li>
          <li>Community Support</li>
          <li>Server-side Development</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Javascript allows for dynamic web pages and client interactivity. It allows for modifications without a full page download. It validates user input forms and reduces errors. Javascript has a large and interactive community of developers.</p>

        <h2>Learning Javascript</h2>
        <p>Understanding the fundamentals of javascript is very important. This includes using variables, data types and functions. Additionally, practicing coding is essential to keeping up to date with the current trends and practice.</p>
        <p>An example of Javascript programming language would be different data types of code as listed below. The variable age is a number data type. The variable isStudent is a boolean data type. The variable name is a string data type. The fruits variable is a an array. The person variable is an object data type.</p>
        <p>
          <ul><code>let age = 25;</code></ul>
          <ul><code>let isStudent = true;</code></ul>
          <ul><code>let name = "John";</code></ul>
          <ul><code>let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']; </code></ul>
          <ul><code>let person = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe"};</code></ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Application Development</h2>
        <p>Javascript is a versatile programming language widely used to build various types of programs.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is fundamental to web development, enabling the creation of interactive and dynamic web pages.With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript has extended its reach from client-side to server-side applications, making it a powerful tool for server-side development.</p>
        <p>JavaScript, in combination with HTML5, is used for game development, offering solutions for working with rich graphics. The EaseJS library provides support for game development.</p>
